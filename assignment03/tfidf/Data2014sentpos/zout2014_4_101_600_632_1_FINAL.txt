SENTPOS 2014_4_101_600_632_1 FINAL A   15    8 If Carr had made this argument five years earlier it would have been significantly weaker because in 2003 very few people relied on the internet for everyday tasks compared to that number in 2008 .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_600_632_1 FINAL A   27   15 Making an argument seem urgent is a key part of developing an argument because if what is being argument does not matter than the audience will not care about the message .
