SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_510_1 FINAL A    1    7 The phrase " She dressed plainly " means that her dresses were plain and there is no specialty on it , which means that anyone could afford this dress and its quality is not that perfect .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_510_1 FINAL A    1    9 Furthermore , if we focus in the phrase " plainly " we see that it is not the opposite of the phrase " very well " because plainly is not a very well dress , and also is not a bad dress , but an appropriate and a good dress .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_510_1 FINAL A    2   14 Furthermore , the word unhappy has been used in the text because it has a strong relationship with the word happy than it is with the word sad .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_510_1 FINAL A    2   16 Using the word " unhappy " in this story would also illustrate that the woman is looking , and searching for happiness ; however , the word sad would not be a better choice to describe the woman in this story .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_510_1 FINAL A    2   17 The word sad seems more powerful , and includes crying , but the word unhappy seems less powerful and also the unhappiness would last longer .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_510_1 FINAL A    3   22 As we see from the example , we understand that the woman did n't know what to do about the invitation , which gives a slight clue that she refuses to go to the party .
