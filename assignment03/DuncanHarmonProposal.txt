For assignment 3 I plan to do SVD on the student essays in order to separate the documents by defi-
ning characteristics. The end result of this project would be to either have a graphical represent-
ation of the clusters of documents and the centroids or to list the documents in each cluster via text (both will
probably be used as each provides its own benefits).

Each document will be a vector in a Vector Space Model, each dimension being the different terms in
the corpus and the positions in each dimension being the frequency of the term. These documents, 
once all gathered in a Document x Term matrix can be transformed via SVD. 

I'm hoping this project will help me develop a further understanding of how an SVD works and its 
uses.

A fun continuation of this would be to compile a list of key topics from each document and create a
searchable library of the documents able to be sorted by key topics, being a VERY simple search
engine. This could be continued even further to be a far more functional search engine (my current
idea for my project).

I'm hoping the results will be better than my attempt at the Thesaurus with the vector space model
as these documents are much larger than the definitions of terms used in the thesaurus. I will 
probably run a cosine analysis on the vectors before and after SVD to see how the results change,
and to see how accurate a cosine analysis is on documents of this size. 

I will have to look again into using SVD, different clustering algorithms to find a quick yet accu-
rate one, and other algorithms to help speed the process up if possible because it is no quick task
with so many dimensions and documents to deal with.
