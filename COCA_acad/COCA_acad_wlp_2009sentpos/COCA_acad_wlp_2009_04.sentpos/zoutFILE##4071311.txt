SENTPOS COCA_acad_wlp_2009_04_FILE##4071311 COCA  A    0    6 Not the least of these barriers is a general lack of awareness of oral cancer among medical providers ( n22-n24 ) and a lack of consensus on the validity of screening for early detection. ( n25-n27 ) A recent review of the medical curricula in the United States by Mouradian et al n28 revealed that little formal education in oral disease , including oral cancer , is being provided , despite the potential impact that physicians could have on oral health promotion , primary prevention , and diagnosis. n29 At a minimum , medical providers need to be educated in medical school , residency training , and continuing education environments that oral health promotion and early diagnosis of that their efforts can be expected to have a positive and discernible impact on oral health outcomes. n29 By themselves , such predisposing and enabling conditions would not guarantee routine opportunistic screening , but they are necessary components of an overall strategy to encourage early detection by medical providers. ( n30 ) We conducted a pilot study designed to answer preliminary questions about our ability to encourage medical clinicians to incorporate primary prevention and early detection of oral cancer into their routine practice .
