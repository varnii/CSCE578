SENTPOS COCA_acad_wlp_2009_01_FILE##4070894 COCA  A    0   13 The idea of an African union , as envisioned by Nkrumah , was revived in the late 1990s , when the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi spearheaded the transformation of the OAU into the AU in July 2002. n5 The AU was established as a functionalist organization , as the preamble of its Constitutive Act acknowledges , noting that " the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent and of the need to promote peace , security and stability as a prerequisite for the implementation of our development and integration agenda. " n6 According to historian David Mitrany , if nations are economically and socially interdependent , then war is less likely. ( n7 ) This functionalist nature of the AU is further reflected in its key objectives ( Article 3 of the Constitutive Act ) , which aim to : achieve greater unity and solidarity among African countries and the peoples of Africa ; defend sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of member states ; accelerate the political and socio-economic integration of the continent ; promote and defend African common positions on issues of interest to the continent and its people ; promote peace , security and stability on the continent ; promote democratic principles and institutions , popular participation and good governance ; and promote and protect human and peoples ' rights. ( n8 ) When the AU was formed , many critics dismissed it as an organization that had merely changed its acronym by dropping one letter. n9 Among the reasons cited for this skepticism were the composition of the organization ' s founders , many whom lacked Pan-Africanist credentials ; the lack of involvement of the African people ; and the inheritance of the OAU organizational culture , incompetent staff modeled on the European Union ( EU ) , on which it continues to rely perhaps too heavily for ideas on institutional development and finances for survival. ( n11 ) Although the AU borrowed the OAU ' s principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of member-states , it also adopted a radical principle of intervention in failed and failing states on request .
