( n1 ) <p> The application charges President al-Bashir with the polarization of ethnic groups into two broadly racialized groups ( Arab and Zurga or black ) , followed by a violent conflict from 2003 to 2005 , leading to the ethnic cleansing of Zurga ethnic groups ( in particular , the Fur , the Masalit and the Zaghawa ) from their traditional tribal lands or dars , and a deceptively non-violent process whereby those forcibly expelled were left to die , either in the desert or from malnutrition , rape or torture , leading to " slow deaths " in the internally displaced persons ( IDP ) camps .
