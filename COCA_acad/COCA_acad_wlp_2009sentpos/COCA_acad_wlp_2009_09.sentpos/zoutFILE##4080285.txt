( n3 ) It follows that : ( 4 ) the Crucifixion was the result of human evil , not divine providence ; ( 5 ) Jesus suffers and dies because he opposes the power of evil , not because he is a surrogate for sinners who deserve punishment ; and ( 6 ) the wounds inflicted on Jesus and the suffering they entail can not redeem humanity from historical evil since they are themselves paradigmatic examples of such evil.
