( n60 ) Pannenberg , for his part , discusses the subject matter of dogmatics with the goal of presenting it as the " unfolding of the Christian idea of God , " ( n61 ) because theology is essentially a Gotteswissenschaft , a doctrine of God and all things in their relation to God. ( n62 ) The influence of Hegel 's philosophy on Pannenberg 's theology is of Trinity and history , within the context of a conceptual approach to the absolute " ( n63 ) and uses this ( Hegelian ) dialectic to present his argument on the unity and plurality in God. ( n64 ) Even though Pannenberg scarcely uses trinitarian language in talking about how God has partaken in human history , the goal of his Systematic Theology is to provide a more thorough trinitarian theology , because the object of theology , when all is said and done , is the truth of God who is Father , Son , and Spirit .
