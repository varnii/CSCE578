SENTPOS 2014_4_101_400_417_2 FINAL A    5   43 Inserting his thesis at the beginning of the article allows the reader to progress through the reader already knowing his ultimate stance on the matter , which is a good strategy for an author to use in attempting to convey a message that could elsewise be lost to interpretation .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_400_417_2 FINAL A    7   56 What it meant by that is the idea that even when writing an essay that is does not directly insert one 's plan of action regarding something , their ideas and opinions can still bring about a response to the audience .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_400_417_2 FINAL A    7   57 For this case , in writing about spreading , sustaining , and scaling the current efforts to stop childhood obesity ( Chang ) the general descriptions of quality become obvious assertions of the authors concerns and desire for change in that subject matter .
