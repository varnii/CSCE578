SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_533_2 FINAL A    1    4 As we see , in the first two words of the text below the picture , it says " The Ghost " , which certainly means that there is a ghost in this image .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_533_2 FINAL A    3   22 As it 's noticed from the painting , the small part that surrounds the candle shines more than the rest of the painting that means that source of light comes from that part .

SENTPOS 2014_4_101_500_533_2 FINAL A    3   23 Furthermore , As it appears in the painting , the candle that the is ghost holding is used to spread the light all over the room because the people who are near to the ghost can be distinguished by the color of their cloth ; however , it looks darker in the further side of the room .
