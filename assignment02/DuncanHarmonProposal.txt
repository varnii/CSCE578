I plan on creating a thesaurus from a dictionary (the GNU as of right now 
and if I don't find one I prefer over that). The end goal of this project 
is to have a dictionary with the term as a key and the similar words in a 
list as the value.

The plan is to create a dictionary of all the terms in the source paired 
with a set of words, throwing out stop words, and comparing the sets of 
words with one another to determine which words are similar.

The comparison would be done by dividing the number of similar words (non 
stop) by the total words (non stop) in the definition of the term. This 
would return a dict of the terms as keys and an ordered list of the similar 
words and their similarity (the comparison described above).
This would require a certain threshold of similarity to be set: almost every 
word will share something with every other word, but that doesn't mean they
are similar; testing and analysing partial data sets would be done to
refine the threshold and make the thesaurus more accurate.

It could be interesting to see if only comparing terms with words of the same
POS would give different results than simply ignoring the POS tags and comparing
all words or if the wording of definitions changes significantly based on the
POS of the word; however, I think this would only happen if stop words were 
included, as stop words have a huge impact of the structure and meaning of a 
sentence). (i.e. fish and swim may have similar key words in the definitions 
but they are defnitely not synonyms).

These variables (comparing POS and leaving out stopwords) will be tested to 
see which provides a more accurate result.
